# Chrome-Bookmark-Tool

Custom chrome extension for additional bookmark functionality.

To install, clone the files and enable developer mode in chrome, and load unpacked and select the root path.

Click extension pin to open menu, then select desired bookmark folder.

You can open a random bookmark from selected folder, and to open ALL bookmarks from selected folder.



Future development may include custom color themes, having the tool on the official chrome extension store, opening random bookmark sets, shuffling and other bookmark organizing, automated bookmark categorizing. I'll add stuff if I think it's valuable.
